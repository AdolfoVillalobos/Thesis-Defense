abstract = {This research investigates the feasibility and viability of applying Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to improve performance with respect to posture recognition based on multi-channel motion data from Wearable Sensors (WS). The authors use the recognition of posture that can be linked to risk of Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD)- among construction workers as the testbed. The proposed approach is based on the use of a DNN model integrating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) that can achieve automated feature engineering and sequential pattern detection. The model performance was evaluated using datasets collected from four construction workers. The proposed model outperformed baseline CNN and LSTM models. Under the personalized modelling approach, it improved recognition performance by 3{\%} from the benchmark Machine Learning models; the improvement is 2{\%} for generalized modelling approach. The proposed model achieves high-performance posture recognition, which facilitates the MSD prevention in construction through monitoring injury-related postures.},

abstract = {Time series classification is an increasing research topic due to the vast amount of time series data that is being created over a wide variety of fields. The particularity of the data makes it a challenging task and different approaches have been taken, including the distance based approach. 1-NN has been a widely used method within distance based time series classification due to its simplicity but still good performance. However, its supremacy may be attributed to being able to use specific distances for time series within the classification process and not to the classifier itself. With the aim of exploiting these distances within more complex classifiers, new approaches have arisen in the past few years that are competitive or which outperform the 1-NN based approaches. In some cases, these new methods use the distance measure to transform the series into feature vectors, bridging the gap between time series and traditional classifiers. In other cases, the distances are employed to obtain a time series kernel and enable the use of kernel methods for time series classification. One of the main challenges is that a kernel function must be positive semi-definite, a matter that is also addressed within this review. The presented review includes a taxonomy of all those methods that aim to classify time series using a distance based approach, as well as a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each method.},

@article{IsmailFawaz2019,
abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

abstract = {The aim was to classify lifting activities into low and high risk categories (according to The Danish Working Environment Authority guidelines) based on surface electromyography (sEMG) and trunk inclination (tri-axial accelerometer) measurements. Lifting tasks with different weights, horizontal distance and technique were performed. The lifting tasks were characterised by a feature vector composed of either the 90th, 95th or 99th percentile of sEMG activity level and trunk inclinations during the task. Linear Discriminant Analysis and a subject-specific threshold scheme were applied and lifting tasks were classified with an accuracy of 65.1–65.5{\%}. When lifts were classified based on the subject-specific threshold scheme from low and upper back accelerometers, the accuracy reached 52.1–58.1{\%} and 72.7–78.1{\%}, respectively. In conclusion, the use of subject-specific thresholds from sEMG from upper trapezius and erector spinae as well as inclination of the upper trunk enabled us to identify low and high risk lifts with an acceptable accuracy. Practitioner Summary: This study contributes to the development of a method enabling the automatic detection of high risk lifting tasks, i.e. exposure to high biomechanical loads, based on individual sEMG and kinematics from an entire working day. These methods may be more cost-effective and may complement observations commonly used by practitioners.},

abstract = {Prolonged standing at work is required by an estimated 60{\%} of the employed population and is associated with a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. ‘Standing' is expected to encompass a range of activities of varying intensity. This study aimed to define a range of ‘standing' work-based activities; and objectively explore differences between ‘standing' occupations. The following movements were defined using a triaxial accelerometer (ActivPAL) through recordings of known movements (n = 11): static standing, weight-shifting, shuffling, walking and sitting. Movements over a working day were defined for chefs (n = 10), veterinary surgeons (n = 7) and office workers (n = 9). Despite veterinary surgeons and chefs spending a similar time in an upright posture, veterinary surgeons spent 62{\%} of this time standing statically whereas chefs split their time between all the movements. Overall, this study provides the first attempt to define ‘standing' activities, allowing the differentiation of activities between occupations spending similar periods of time upright. Practitioner Summary: This study identified a range of work-based ‘standing' activities of varying intensity. Differences in activity were recorded between two occupations spending a similar time in an upright posture (veterinary surgeons and chefs). A broader definition of standing activities could be important when considering factors related to musculoskeletal disorders at work.},

@article{Ho2016,
abstract = {Smart environments and monitoring systems are popular research areas nowadays due to its potential to enhance the quality of life. Applications such as human behavior analysis and workspace ergonomics monitoring are automated, thereby improving well-being of individuals with minimal running cost. The central problem of smart environments is to understand what the user is doing in order to provide the appropriate support. While it is difficult to obtain information of full body movement in the past, depth camera based motion sensing technology such as Kinect has made it possible to obtain 3D posture without complex setup. This has fused a large number of research projects to apply Kinect in smart environments. The common bottleneck of these researches is the high amount of errors in the detected joint positions, which would result in inaccurate analysis and false alarms. In this paper, we propose a framework that accurately classifies the nature of the 3D postures obtained by Kinect using a max-margin classifier. Different from previous work in the area, we integrate the information about the reliability of the tracked joints in order to enhance the accuracy and robustness of our framework. As a result, apart from general classifying activity of different movement context, our proposed method can classify the subtle differences between correctly performed and incorrectly performed movement in the same context. We demonstrate how our framework can be applied to evaluate the user's posture and identify the postures that may result in musculoskeletal disorders. Such a system can be used in workplace such as offices and factories to reduce risk of injury. Experimental results have shown that our method consistently outperforms existing algorithms in both activity classification and posture healthiness classification. Due to the low cost and the easy deployment process of depth camera based motion sensors, our framework can be applied widely in home and office to facilitate smart environments.},

Although deep neural networks have exhibited superior performance in various tasks, interpretability is always Achilles' heel of deep neural networks. At present, deep neural networks obtain high discrimination power at the cost of a low interpretability of their black-box representations. We believe that high model interpretability may help people break several bottlenecks of deep learning, e.g., learning from a few annotations, learning via human–computer communications at the semantic level, and semantically debugging network representations. We focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and revisit the visualization of CNN representations, methods of diagnosing representations of pre-trained CNNs, approaches for disentangling pre-trained CNN representations, learning of CNNs with disentangled representations, and middle-to-end learning based on model interpretability. Finally, we discuss prospective trends in explainable artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are the leading cause of the nonfatal injuries for construction workers, and a worker's overexertion is a major source of such WMSDs. Pushing, pulling, and carrying movements—which are all activities largely associated with physical loads—account for 35{\%} of WMSDs. However, most previous studies have focused on the identification of non-ergonomic postures, and there has been limited effort expended on measuring a worker's exposures to the physical loads caused by materials or tools during construction tasks. With the advantage of using a wearable inertial measurement sensor to monitor a worker's bodily movements, this study investigates the feasibility of identifying various physical loading conditions by analyzing a worker's lower body movements. In the experiment with laboratory settings, workers performed a load carrying task by moving concrete bricks. A bidirectional long short-term memory algorithm is employed to classify physical load levels; this approach achieved 74.6 to 98.6{\%} accuracy and 0.59 to 0.99 F-score in classification. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach in identifying the states of physical loads. The findings of this study contribute to the literature on classifying ergonomically at-risk workers and on preventing WMSDs in high physical demand occupations, thereby helping enhance the health and safety of the construction workplace.},

abstract = {Low back pain (LBP) remains one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders, while algorithms that able to recognise LBP patients from healthy population using balance performance data are rarely seen. In this study, human balance and body sway performance during standing trials were utilised to recognise chronic LBP populations using deep neural networks. To be specific, 44 chronic LBP and healthy individuals performed static standing tasks, while their spine kinematics and centre of pressure were recorded. A deep learning network with long short-term memory units was used for training, prediction and implementation. The performance of the model was evaluated by: (a) overall accuracy, (b) precision, (c) recall, (d) F1 measure, (e) receiver-operating characteristic and (f) area under the curve. Results indicated that deep neural networks could recognise LBP populations with precision up to 97.2{\%} and recall up to 97.2{\%}. Meanwhile, the results showed that the model with the C7 sensor output performed the best. Practitioner summary: Low back pain (LBP) remains the most common musculoskeletal disorder. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of applying artificial intelligent deep neural network in detecting LBP population from healthy controls with their kinematics data. Results showed a deep learning network can solve the above classification problem with both promising precision and recall performance.},

abstract = {Gradient boosting constructs additive regression models by sequentially fitting a simple parameterized function (base learner) to current "pseudo" -residuals by least squares at each iteration. The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Freund1997,
abstract = {In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in a worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone-Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in ℝn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

For ergonomists, extracting postural information such as joint angles is necessary to evaluating ergonomic assessment metrics. This allows the early identification of potential work-related musculoskeletal disorders in manufacturing industries, and thus providing adequate interventions. In this paper, we present a holistic posture analysis system that estimates body joint angles from an input depth image. The proposed method utilizes the low cost Kinect sensor for data acquisition and a deep convolutional neural network model for joint angles regression. Further, we rely on learning from synthetic training images to allow simulating several physical tasks by different workers and obtain a highly generalizable learning model. The corresponding ground truth joint angles have been generated using a novel inverse kinematic stage. The proposed method achieves high joint angels prediction rate by recording an average MAE of 4.67 deg and RMSE of 6.64 deg.},

abstract = {Inadequate postures adopted by an operator at work are among the most important risk factors in Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs). Although several studies have focused on inadequate posture, there is limited information on its identification in a work context. The aim of this study is to automatically differentiate between adequate and inadequate postures using two wearable devices (helmet and instrumented insole) with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and force sensors. From the force sensors located inside the insole, the center of pressure (COP) is computed since it is considered an important parameter in the analysis of posture. In a first step, a set of 60 features is computed with a direct approach, and later reduced to eight via a hybrid feature selection. A neural network is then employed to classify the current posture of a worker, yielding a recognition rate of 90{\%}. In a second step, an innovative graphic approach is proposed to extract three additional features for the classification. This approach represents the main contribution of this study. Combining both approaches improves the recognition rate to 95{\%}. Our results suggest that neural network could be applied successfully for the classification of adequate and inadequate posture.},

The application of wearable sensors to track movement has emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance the care provided to patients with neurologic or musculoskeletal conditions. These sensors enable quantification of motor behavior across disparate patient populations and emerging research shows their potential for identifying motor biomarkers, differentiating between restitution and compensation motor recovery mechanisms, remote monitoring, telerehabilitation, and robotics. Moreover, the big data recorded across these applications serve as a pathway to personalized and precision medicine. This article presents state-of-the-art and next-generation wearable movement sensors, ranging from inertial measurement units to soft sensors. An overview of clinical applications is presented across a wide spectrum of conditions that have potential to benefit from wearable sensors, including stroke, movement disorders, knee osteoarthritis, and running injuries. Complementary applications enabled by next-generation sensors that will enable point-of-care monitoring of neural activity and muscle dynamics during movement also are discussed.},

@article{Chen2018,
abstract = {Risk factors, such as overexertion, awkward postures, excessive repetition, and the combination of these factors are main causes of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). In this paper, we proposed an automatic WMSDs risk factors identification and visualization method based on Wearable and Connected Gait Analytics System (WCGAS) and Kinect skeleton models. WCGAS was capable of recording plantar pressure from which postures, force exertions, and repetitions could be recognized with algorithms such as sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm and long short term memory (LSTM) network. Kinect skeleton models were used to make the WMSDs risk factors visualized. Experiments with quasi-static and sequential postures were designed to evaluate the recognition performance of work-related motion type (i.e. “lifting” “carrying” “bending” “pulling” and “pushing”). A load variable (with/without 10 kg load) was introduced for evaluating the performance of force exertions recognition. 5 repetitions of each motion were used for evaluating the performance of repetitions recognition. Results showed that quasi-static postures could be recognized with 100{\%} accuracy and the accuracy for sequential motions recognition were 74{\%}, 79{\%}, 92{\%}, 99{\%} and 99{\%} for “bending” “carrying” “lifting” “pulling” and “pushing” respectively. Force exertions were recognized with 100{\%} accuracy. For repetitions recognition, except the accuracy in the “bending” motion was 80{\%}, the repetitions of other motions could be recognized correctly. Kinect skeleton model showed its ability of making the WMSDs risk factors vivid which would contribute to the accuracy of WMSDs risks evaluation. These results indicated that it is possible to use WCGAS and Kinect skeleton models for WMSDs risk factors identification and visualization applications.},

@article{Buisseret2018,
abstract = {Background: Routine ergonomic assessment of postures and gestures in the workplace are mostly conducted by visual observations, either direct or based on video recordings. Nowadays, low-cost three-dimensional cameras like Microsoft Kinect offers the possibility of recording the full kinematics of workers in a non-intrusive way, providing a more precise, and reliable assessment of their motor strategies. Methods: We have developed a tracking application using the Kinect SDK for Windows in C♯, allowing the simultaneous recording of the three-dimensional coordinates of all the body points tracked by the Microsoft Kinect at a sampling frequency of 30 Hz and an expected accuracy of 3 cm. Measurements are performed on violinists, whose playing is representative of a work situation involving repeated gestures and postures that can be described as non-ergonomic. Results: Microsoft Kinect can be efficiently used to quantify the motion performed by the violinists. Playing strategies can even be noticed despite the low-cost nature of the sensor used. Conclusion: Low-cost three-dimensional cameras can be a useful aid in ergonomic risk assessment of developing musculoskeletal disorders and give the example of the repetition of movements and postural items included in the OCRA checklist, whose scoring can be facilitated by such a device.},

abstract = {The force exposure associated with meat cutting operations and the effect of knife sharpness on performance and productivity have not been well documented. Specialized hardware was used to measure grip force and reactive moments with 15 professional meat cutters performing lamb shoulder boning, beef rib trimming and beef loin trim operations in a field study conducted in two meat packing plants. A system for measuring relative blade sharpness was developed for this study. Mean and peak cutting moments observed for the meat cutting operations, averaged across subjects were 4.7 and 17.2Nm for the shoulder boning, 3.5 and 12.9Nm for the rib trim, and 2.3 and 10.6Nm for the loin trim, respectively. Expressed as percent of MVC, mean grip forces of 28.3{\%} and peak grip forces of 72.6{\%} were observed overall. Blade sharpness was found to effect grip forces, cutting moments and cutting time, with sharper blades requiring statistically significantly lower peak and mean cutting moments, and grip forces than dull knives. Efforts aimed at providing and maintaining sharp blades could have a significant impact on force exposure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Three cycles of the shoulder deboning task were measured for each worker, using an instrumented knife that provided direct measurements of grip forces and cutting moments applied to the knife. The average grip force values during the task were between 11 and 35{\%} of the maximum voluntary grip force. A key finding was that there is high between-subject variation in exposure to integrated grip forces and cutting moments, which can have implications for exposure to risk for upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders. There was also high between-subject variation in cutting time. Measures of knife sharpness indicated that there is also variation in knife maintenance among workers during a 5-hour period. The implications of the results for training and further study are discussed.},

One potential adminis- trative control would be to maintain knife sharpness so that exposure is minimized.


Effect of experience. Clearly, a number of knives tested after being used were dulled consid- erably, indicating that more frequent use of the mousetrap is warranted, or possibly the use of a different method of sharp- ening. 

The number of cuts and number of
sawing motions were positively correlated with cutting time, thus it appears that these measures can be used as a gross indication of training level. They can also be used to train workers, as minimizing the number of cuts required and elim- inating the need to use sawing motions should lead to reduced force exposure.},

@article{Murad2017,
abstract = {Adopting deep learning methods for human activity recognition has been effective in extracting discriminative features from raw input sequences acquired from body-worn sensors. Although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time, typical machine learning methods perform recognition tasks without exploiting the temporal correlations between input data samples. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) address this issue by using convolutions across a one-dimensional temporal sequence to capture dependencies among input data. However, the size of convolutional kernels restricts the captured range of dependencies between data samples. As a result, typical models are unadaptable to a wide range of activity recognition configurations and require fixed-length input windows. In this paper, we propose the use of deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for building recognition models that are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. We present unidirectional, bidirectional, and cascaded architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) DRNNs and evaluate their effectiveness on miscellaneous benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform methods employing conventional machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Additionally, the proposed models yield better performance than other deep learning techniques, such as deep believe networks (DBNs) and CNNs.},

However, there was no significant difference between the condition “with job rotation - tasks {\textgreater}1h” and “without job rotation” (p = 0.155). Thus, job rotations with intervals {\textless}1h reduced the risk of developing UL-WMSDs. Job rotations with {\textless}1 h intervals in poultry slaughterhouses are recommended along with further studies to verify the effectiveness of rotations with more than two tasks, involving mild or non-repetitive tasks.},

abstract = {Slaughterhouse work involves a high degree of repetitive and forceful upper limb movements and thus implies an elevated risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. High intensity strength training effectively rehabilitates musculoskeletal disorders among sedentary employees, but less is known about the effect among workers with repetitive and forceful work demands. Before performing randomized controlled trials it may be beneficial to assess the cross-sectional connection between exercise and musculoskeletal pain. We investigated the association between high intensity physical exercise and pain among 595 slaughterhouse workers in Denmark, Europe. Using logistic regression analyses, odds ratios for pain and work disability as a function of physical exercise, gender, age, BMI, smoking, and job position were estimated. The prevalence of pain in the neck, shoulder, elbow, and hand/wrist was 48{\%}, 60{\%}, 40{\%}, and 52{\%}, respectively. The odds for experiencing neck pain were significantly lower among slaughterhouse workers performing physical exercise (OR = 0.70, CI: 0.49-0.997), whereas the odds for pain in the shoulders, elbow, or hand/wrist were not associated with exercise. The present study can be used as general reference of pain in the neck and upper extremity among slaughterhouse workers. Future studies should investigate the effect of high intensity physical exercise on neck and upper limb pain in slaughterhouse workers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Emil Sundstrup et al.},

The proposal, which still has to be substantiated and validated by further studies and applications, is conceptually based on the procedure recommended by the NIOSH for calculating the Lifting Index in manual load handling activities. The concise exposure index (OCRA index) in this case is based on the relationship between the daily number of actions actually performed by the upper limbs in repetitive tasks, and the corresponding number of recommended actions. The latter are calculated on the basis of a constant (30 actions per minute), which represents the action frequency factor; it is valid - hypothetically - under so-called optimal conditions; the constant is diminished case by case (using appropriate factors) as a function of the presence and characteristics of the other risk factors (force, posture, additional elements, recovery periods). Although still experimental, the exposure index can be used to obtain an integrated and concise assessment of the various risk factors analysed and to classify occupational scenarios featuring significant and diversified exposure to such risk factors.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the risks associated with the repetitive movements of the upper limbs in different meat processing tasks in a poultry slaughterhouse. The study was conducted in a company with 4,500 workers that slaughtered 450,000 chickens/poultries per day during the two shifts. The OCRA checklist was used to assess 10{\%} of the total workforce during work tasks. Each worker was filmed for shorter periods of 5 minutes. Student's t-test (p≤0.05) was used to compare the risk variable between the sides of the body. The 26 work activities analyzed were the following sectors: cutting (17); evisceration (2); freezing tunnels (2); reception (3) and scalding (2). The average of occupational repetitive actions performed by poultry workers was 63.7±25.3 per minute, representing 9 points in the OCRA's scale (0 to 10 points scale). The average score of OCRA's checklist was 18.3±2.7 (moderate risk). The scores for the right upper limb (18±2.8 - moderate risk) were significantly higher (p=0.014) than the contralateral limb (16.9±3.8 - moderate risk). Considering the five risk categories proposed by the OCRA method, 2 work tasks were considered high risk (8{\%}); 21 represented moderate risk (81{\%}), and 3 were within an low risk (11{\%}). When grouping the high risk tasks with the moderate risk tasks, it was verified that the majority of the slaughterhouse workers were vulnerable to ergonomic hazards by repetitive movements. From these results, it is possible to suggest that poultry processing tasks classified as high (8{\%}) and moderate risk (81{\%}) predispose workers to a greater probability of developing upper limb work-related musculoskeletal disorders ({\textgreater}21.5{\%} probability for high risk and 10.8 to 21.5{\%} for moderate risk).},

The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational efficiency.

Twenty-two meat-cutting workers from three different companies participated in the study. The methods included measurements of knife sharpness in relation to real work situations and consideration of the way meat-cutting and sharpening operations were organised. Results showed that the type of meat-cutting activities, the steeling strategy adopted by the worker, including the types of tool used, and the overall organisation of the sharpening task all had a significant influence on how knife sharpness evolved over a 2-h period and over an entire working day. To improve MSD prevention, sharpening and steeling operations should not be considered as independent activities, but taken into account as a continuity of working actions. Appropriate assessment of knife sharpness by meat cutters affects how they organise meat-cutting and sharpening tasks.},

This study prompted design of a specific system for measuring initial cutting capacity and cutting edge retention. This design process preceded research into test conditions (cutting speed, sample nature and thickness, knife inclination angle, etc.) offering optimum test bench operation. This equipment was then used to study the influence of blade inclination angle, steel grade and sharpening angle on cutting performance. It has been shown that cutting force varies with blade inclination. Use of knives with curved blades and/or a blade inclined with respect to the knife handle is therefore preferred in relation to our cutting force reduction objective. It has also been shown that choices are in fact governed by compromises in relation to other parameters (steel grade and edge angle). These observations confirm the need to set up suitable training of knife users to achieve best possible cutting performance. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper examines the new study of hand orientation as a substitute for computer-mouse movement and is evaluated based on ISO/TS 9241 part 411: Ergonomics of human-system interaction-evaluation methods for the design of physical input devices. Two pairs of hand-orientation candidates were evaluated, using, for example, pitch-roll and pitch-yaw to substitute for up-down and left-right mouse-cursor movements. The up-down cursor movement was generated from the pitch orientation, while the left-right cursor movement was generated from the roll or yaw orientation, depending on the evaluation of the proposed gesture. The research employed a standard computer mouse as a baseline comparison for the study. The empirical study was conducted to evaluate quantitative performance such as throughput and movement time. The best impression resulted when the throughput had the greatest value as well as the shortest movement time. The performance test was based on Fitts's law using a multi-directional tapping test as suggested by ISO/TS 9241-411. The test was divided into several levels of difficulty, including high, medium, low, and very low. The other assessment is qualitative and was performed using the comfort-rating scale questionnaire and rating of perceived exertion of comfortability and fatigue. The quantitative results show that pitch-yaw throughput is slightly higher than for the pitch-roll gesture, and that the movement time in pitch-yaw is slightly less than in pitch-roll, although there is no statistically significant difference between the two. We also found that pitch-yaw movements have a higher level of comfort based on the comfort-rating scale test. Since the test was divided into levels of difficulty, we identified those gestures suitable for the task with a low and very low level of difficulty based on throughput, movement time, and error-rate results. Finally, this study suggests that pitch-roll and pitch-yaw movements of the hand can be used as substitutes for the mouse, and that pitch-yaw movements are superior in regard to causing less fatigue than pitch-roll movements. Furthermore, this study provides a new suggestion for a suitable level of difficulty when using an inertial sensor as an emulator for the movement of a mouse cursor in the field of human-computer interaction.},

abstract = {Activity monitoring is a very important task in lifestyle and health domains where physical activity of a person plays an important role in further reasoning or for providing personalized recommendations. To make such services available to a broader population, one should use devices that most users already have, such as smartphones. Since trends show an increasing popularity of wrist-worn wearables we also consider a sensor-rich wristband as an optional device in this research. We present a real-time activity monitoring algorithm which utilizes data from the smartphone sensors, wristband sensors or their fusion for activity recognition and estimation of energy expenditure of the user. The algorithm detects which devices are present and uses an interval of walking for gravity detection and normalization of the orientation of the devices. The normalized data is afterwards used for the detection of the location of the smartphone on the body, which serves as a context for the selection of location-specific classification model for activity recognition. The recognized activity is finally used for the selection of one or multiple regression models for the estimation of the user's energy expenditure. To develop the machine-learning models, which can be deployed on the smartphone, we optimized the number and type of extracted features via automatic feature selection. We evaluated each step of the algorithm and each device configuration, and compared the human energy expenditure estimation results against the Bodymedia armband and Microsoft Band 2. We also evaluated the benefit of decision fusion where appropriate. The results show that we achieve a 87{\%} ± 5{\%} average accuracy for activity recognition and that we outperformed both competing devices in the estimation of human energy expenditure by achieving the mean absolute error of 0.6 ± 0.1 MET on average.},

Specifically, deep learning methods based on the CNN and RNN architectures have been adopted for motion recognition using RGB-D data. In this paper, a detailed overview of recent advances in RGB-D-based motion recognition is presented.

First, a biomechanical model of the upper body has been developed by using inertial sensors placed at different locations on the upper body. Based on this model, a computerized RULA ergonomic assessment was implemented to permit a global risk assessment of musculoskeletal disorders in real-time. Furthermore, local scores were calculated per segment, e.g. the neck region, and gave information on the local risks for musculoskeletal disorders. Visual information was fed back to the user by using a see-through head mounted display. Additional visual highlighting and auditory warnings were provided when some predefined thresholds were exceeded. In a user study (N = 12 participants) a group with the RULA feedback was compared to a control group. Results demonstrate that the real-time ergonomic feedback significantly decreased the outcome of both globally as well as locally hazardous RULA values that are associated with increased risk for musculoskeletal disorders. Task execution time did not differ between groups. The real-time ergonomic tool introduced in this study has the potential to considerably reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in industrial settings. Implications for ergonomics in manufacturing and user feedback modalities are further discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to show a method that can be used to monitor the human posture in an industrial environment. The method is based on the fu- sion of the data coming from two different sensors: a time-of-flight camera (Microsoft Kinect V2) and a wearable motion capture system that uses inertial measurement units to identify the body posture (Notch Wearable). The combined use of these two systems overcomes the intrinsic limitations of the two methods, deriving from occlusions and electromagnetic interferences, respectively. First, the algorithms implemented and the calibration of the two measurement systems in a controlled environment are described. Second, the method applied in a workplace to monitor the posture of the workers during different tailoring operations, is explained. The data acquired have been analyzed in the time domain, and used to compute the cumulative probability density function of different body angles. The results are compared to the subjective evaluation of occupational doctors, and used to compute the OCRA index in an auto- mated way, for the assessment of workers exposure to repetitive movements of the upper limbs.},

abstract = {The purpose of this commentary is to present recent epidemiological findings regarding work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) of the hand and wrist, and to summarize experimental evidence of underlying tissue pathophysiology and sensorimotor changes in WMSDs. Sixty-five percent of the 333 800 newly reported cases of occupational illness in 2001 were attributed to repeated trauma. WMSDs of the hand and wrist are associated with the longest absences from work and are, therefore, associated with greater lost productivity and wages than those of other anatomical regions. Selected epidemiological studies of hand/wrist WMSDs published since 1998 are reviewed and summarized. Results from selected animal studies concerning underlying tissue pathophysiology in response to repetitive movement or tissue loading are reviewed and summarized. To the extent possible, corroborating evidence in human studies for various tissue pathomechanisms suggested in animal models is presented. Repetitive, hand-intensive movements, alone or in combination with other physical, nonphysical, and nonoccupational risk factors, contribute to the development of hand/wrist WMSDs. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms of tissue injury include inflammation followed by repair and/or fibrotic scarring, peripheral nerve injury, and central nervous system reorganization. Clinicians should consider all of these pathomechanisms when examining and treating patients with hand/wrist WMSDs.},

abstract = {Meat cutting is associated with several ergonomic risk factors and a high risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The development of new production systems points to an increased degree of mechanization; instead of subdividing split carcasses of pigs with a knife, the halves are trisected by an electrical saw into 'sixth-parts', resulting in shorter work cycles for the workers. Recently, machine-directed line-production systems have been implemented. This study evaluates differences in the physical workload between the production systems.The postures and movements (inclinometry and goniometry) and muscular load (electromyography) of workers in the split-carcass- (five subjects), sixth-part- (ten) and line-production systems (five) were recorded.Most measures showed a statistically significant trend of declining physical exposure with increasing degrees of mechanization. For example, movement velocities of the upper arm were higher in the split-carcass system (50th percentile: mean 209°/s) than in the sixth-part (103°/s) and line production (81°/s). However, the latter two were not statistically significantly different.A novel method for quantifying posture variation, based on inclinometry, showed that the split-carcass system implied the highest variation of the upper arm postures " within-minute" (i.e., a high range of motion each minute), but the lowest " between-minute" (i.e., a low variation during the course of the workday).In conclusion, the physical workload in the line-production system was significantly lower than in the split-carcass one, and tended also to be lower than in the sixth-part system. However, there may be disadvantages in line production, such as machine-directed work pace and shorter work cycles. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

@article{Lim2020,
abstract = {Accurate, reliable, and cost-effective quantification of real-time biomechanical exposures in occupational settings remains an enduring pursuit in ergonomics. Miniaturized, wireless, body-worn inertial sensors offer opportunities to directly measure vast and personalized kinematics data in both laboratory and applied settings. This review investigated the contemporary and emerging uses of wearable inertial sensing technology in occupational ergonomics research related to biomechanical exposure assessment in physical work. A review and narrative synthesis of 78 peer-reviewed studies was conducted. A conceptual framework was used for scoping and synthesizing the reviewed scientific literature. Review findings help to contextualize contributions of this emerging technology to the broader goals of reducing work-relevant musculoskeletal trauma disorders. The review made evident that despite the growing interest in wearable inertial sensing technologies for ergonomics research, its use in applied settings still lags. The review also identified differences in sensor attachment locations and methods and measures for calibration and validation, and inconsistent criteria for reporting and assessing biomechanical exposures even across studies with similar objectives. Emerging applications include combining inertial sensing with predictive modeling for obtaining cumulative exposure data, and providing real-time feedback about biomechanical work demands. The manuscript concludes with research directions for enabling inertial sensing technologies as a tool for online biomechanical exposure assessment and feedback, which has particular appeal in non-repetitive work settings. Relevance to industry: Despite the growing interest in wearable inertial sensing technologies for ergonomics research, its use in applied settings still lags. This manuscript explores contemporary and emerging uses of body-worn inertial sensing for assessing biomechanical exposures and reducing the risk of work-relevant musculoskeletal disorders.},

abstract = {Today's changing work environment focuses on work organization and new forms of cooperation (outsourcing, decentralization of resources, introduction of new technologies, etc.) [1,2]. Organizations sustainable development is linked to the business success in the long-term run. It can be achieved with the help of organization‘s social and technical development, healthy work environment and competitive workers. Musculo-skeletal disorders (MSD), including lower back pain, arm and neck muscle or tendon sprains and joint diseases have a significant impact on employees' workability not only at the individual level but also at national perspective [3,4]. MSD affects efficiency, productivity and overall quality in every organization and labor market [5]. The aim of research is to discover most appropriate economic analytical methods for work-related MSD cost prediction in Latvian enterprises. This research focuses on the analysis of literature of various economic analytical methods for work-related MSD cost prediction at the organisations. Experts in ergonomics field suggests dividing ergonomic intervention costs to avoid MSD into four main categories [6]: Staff, equipment and material, reduced production and sales volume, overhead costs. World literature analysis shows that by increasing ergonomics preventive and assessment costs, considerably decreases costs of human and technology errors in the processes. Hence, it is possibility to gain additional profit that could be diverted for further preventive actions in order to continuously minimize MSD [6–8]. The combination and modification of economic analysis methods of economic loss mathematical calculations [9,10] and Washington State Ergonomics Cost Benefit Calculator is suitable for work-related MSD cost prediction and ergonomics solution cost and benefit analysis in European enterprises.},

By identifying statistically significant time series characteristics in an early stage of the data science process, tsfresh closes feedback loops with domain experts and fosters the development of domain specific features early on. The package implements standard APIs of time series and machine learning libraries (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn) and is designed for both exploratory analyses as well as straightforward integration into operational data science applications.},

abstract = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},
