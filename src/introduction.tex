\frame{\sectionpage}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    \begin{alertblock}{State of the Slaughterhouse Industry\hfill (BMUB 2015/16)}
    \begin{enumerate}%[<+->]\itemsep9pt
    \item Labour is a high pertcentage of the costs.
    \item Fatigue and bad practices lead to injuries, absenteesim and costs.
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    \begin{alertblock}{State of the IoT industry}
    \begin{enumerate}%[<+->]\itemsep9pt
    \item IoT market has grown dramatically in the last five years.
    \item IoT market share by sector shows that wearable technology still represent a small proportion of the total (3\%).
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
    \begin{alertblock}{Oportunity}
    \begin{enumerate}%[<+->]\itemsep9pt
    \item Sensing technologies have been used in human activity recognition tasks, particularly in sports.
    \item This shows an opportunity of improvement in occupational domains. The benefits are: Risk and lesion reduction, lower fatigue, increase productivity and increase efficiency.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review}
    \begin{alertblock}{Assessment of WRMSDs}
    \begin{enumerate}%[<+->]\itemsep9pt
    \item Work-Related Muscukuloskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs) are the leading cause of work disability, sickness and absence from work \cite{Bevan2015}.
    \item RULA and OCRA Check List surveys are the standard assessment methodology \cite{McAtamney1993, Occhipinti1998}.
    \item Microsoft Kinect 3D cameras or intricate arrangements of IMUs, placed over the worker's body, have been used with good results \cite{Vignais2013,Buisseret2018, Chen2018}
    \item Others have used Deep Learning black-box models in work environments to detect bad postures \cite{Barkallah2017,Abobakr2017,Hu2018}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review}
    \begin{alertblock}{Assessment of WRMSDs}
        A review of predictive modeling techniques in occupational domains showed that practitioners still
        haven't fulfilled the promised of using IoT technologies to assess risk factors \cite{Lim2020}.
    \end{alertblock}
    \begin{alertblock}{Limitations}
        In summary, currently approaches are powerful but hard to be implemented outside the lab due to high model complexity, high sensor cost,
        highly dependent on controlled conditions or resisted by workers.
